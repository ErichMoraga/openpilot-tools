Requirements
============

openpilot-tools and the following setup steps are developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04, MacOS 10.14.2 and Python 2.7.

Setup
============


1. Install native dependencies (Mac and Ubuntu sections listed below)
    
    **Ubuntu script based installation**
    ```bash
    ./install_ubuntu.sh
    ```

    ** Mac OS script based installation **
    ```bash
    ./install_mac.sh
    ```
2. Clone openpilot if you haven't already

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/commaai/openpilot.git
    cd openpilot
    ```

    **For Mac users**

    Recompile longitudinal_mpc for mac

    Navigate to:
    ``` bash
    cd selfdrive/controls/lib/longitudinal_mpc
    make clean
    make
    ```

3. Clone tools within openpilot, and install dependencies

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/commaai/openpilot-tools.git tools
    cd tools
    # sudo pip install if not using a venv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r ../requirements_openpilot.txt
    ```

4. Add openpilot to your `PYTHONPATH`.

    For bash users:
    ```bash
    echo 'export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:<path-to-openpilot>"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

5. Add some folders to root
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /data
    sudo mkdir /data/params
    sudo chown $USER /data/params
    ```

6. Try out some tools!


Tool examples
============


Replay driving data
-------------

**Hardware needed**: none

`unlogger.py` replays data collected with [chffrplus](https://github.com/commaai/chffrplus) or [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot).

You'll need to download log and camera files into a local directory. Download these from the footer of the comma [explorer](https://my.comma.ai) or SCP from your device.

Usage:

```
python replay/unlogger.py <route-name> <path-to-data-directory>

#Example:

#python replay/unlogger.py '99c94dc769b5d96e|2018-11-14--13-31-42' /home/batman/unlogger_data

#Within /home/batman/unlogger_data:
#  99c94dc769b5d96e|2018-11-14--13-31-42--0--fcamera.hevc
#  99c94dc769b5d96e|2018-11-14--13-31-42--0--rlog.bz2
#  ...

# In another terminal you can run a debug visualizer:
python replay/ui.py   # Define the environmental variable HORIZONTAL is the ui layout is too tall
```

Debug car controls
-------------

**Hardware needed**: [panda](panda.comma.ai), [giraffe](https://comma.ai/shop/products/giraffe/), joystick

Use the panda's OBD-II port to connect with your car and a usb cable to connect the panda to your pc.
Also, connect a joystick to your pc.

`joystickd.py` runs a deamon that reads inputs from a joystick and publishes them over zmq.
`boardd.py` sends the CAN messages from your pc to the panda.
`debug_controls` is a mocked version of `controlsd.py` and uses input from a joystick to send controls to your car.

Usage:
```
python carcontrols/joystickd.py

# In another terminal:
selfdrive/boardd/boardd.py # Make sure the safety setting is hardcoded to ALL_OUTPUT

# In another terminal:
python carcontrols/debug_controls.py

```

Stream replayed CAN messages to EON
-------------

**Hardware needed**: 2 x [panda](panda.comma.ai), [debug board](https://comma.ai/shop/products/panda-debug-board/), [EON](https://comma.ai/shop/products/eon-gold-dashcam-devkit/).

It is possible to replay CAN messages as they were recorded and forward them to a EON.Â 
Connect 2 pandas to the debug board. A panda connects to the PC, the other panda connects to the EON.

Usage:
```
# With MOCK=1 boardd will read logged can messages from a replay and send them to the panda.
MOCK=1 tools/replay/boardd.py

# In another terminal:
python replay/unlogger.py <route-name> <path-to-data-directory>

```

Stream EON video data to a PC
-------------

**Hardware needed**: [EON](https://comma.ai/shop/products/eon-gold-dashcam-devkit/), [comma Smays](https://comma.ai/shop/products/comma-smays-adapter/).

You can connect your EON to your pc using the Ethernet cable provided with the comma Smays and you'll be able to stream data from your EON, in real time, with low latency. A useful application is being able to stream the raw video frames at 20fps, as captured by the EON's camera.

Usage:
```
# ssh into the eon and run loggerd with the flag "--stream". In ../selfdrive/manager.py you can change:
# ...
# "loggerd": ("selfdrive/loggerd", ["./loggerd"]),
# ...
# with:
# ...
# "loggerd": ("selfdrive/loggerd", ["./loggerd", "--stream"]),
# ...

# On the PC:
# To receive frames from the EON and re-publish them. Set PYGAME env variable if you want to display the video stream
python streamer/streamerd.py
```

Welcomed contributions
=============

* Documentation: code comments, better tutorials, etc..
* Support for other platforms other than Ubuntu 16.04.
* Performance improvements: the tools have been developed on high-performance workstations (12+ logical cores with 32+ GB of RAM), so they are not optimized for running efficiently. For example, `ui.py` might not be able to run real-time on most PCs.
* More tools: anything that you think might be helpful to others.
